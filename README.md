# Software Quality Assurance Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Portfolio. This repository serves as a centralized showcase of my expertise in ensuring software reliability, data integrity, and system performance through automated and manual testing methodologies.

## 🚀 Core Competencies

### 1. API Testing & Automated Validation (`/api-testing`)
I focus on **Contract Testing** and **Functional Logic** to ensure the communication layer between services remains robust.
* **Tools:** Postman, Newman, JavaScript.
* **Focus:** Schema validation, status code assertions, and business logic verification.

### 2. Database Auditing & Performance (`/SQL-Queries`)
I treat the database as a primary test surface, auditing both the data itself and the engine's health.
* **Validation:** Complex Joins and Unions to identify orphaned records and data corruption.
* **Performance:** Identifying bottlenecks, long-running queries, and deadlock risks.

### 3. Comprehensive Bug Reporting (`/Bug-Reports`)
Clear communication is the bridge between Testing and Development. My reports are designed to reduce "back-and-forth" and accelerate fixes.
* **Structure:** Detailed bug report with environment, steps, and results.
* **Priority:** Risk-based assessment to help Product Owners prioritize the backlog.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Testing:** Postman, Selenium, Axe DevTools, Playwright.
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL.
* **Infrastructure:** VMware/VirtualBox (Environment Isolation), VPN/SSH (Remote Networking).
* **Project Management:** Jira, GitHub Issues, Trello, Microsoft Azure.

## 📈 Testing Philosophy
I believe that Quality is a **Product Feature**, not an afterthought. My approach integrates testing early in the SDLC (Shift-Left) to identify vulnerabilities and performance regressions before they reach production.
